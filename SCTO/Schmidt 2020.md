Title: "Archetypes of Gamification: Analysis of mHealth Apps"
ShortSummary: This research addresses the lack of knowledge concerning best practices in the design and implementation of gamification for health-related mobile apps by identifying archetypes of gamification approaches that have emerged in pertinent health-related mobile apps and analyzing to what extent those gamification approaches are influenced by the underlying desired health-related outcomes.

> [!tldr] Summary
> This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of gamification approaches in mHealth apps. It identifies eight archetypes of gamification and discusses their relationship with the targeted health behaviors. I found the systematic approach to identifying and analyzing gamification archetypes particularly interesting.

> [!quote] Quotable
> "Eight archetypes of gamification emerged from the analysis of health-related mobile apps: (1) competition and collaboration, (2) pursuing self-set goals without rewards, (3) episodical compliance tracking, (4) inherent gamification for external goals, (5) internal rewards for self-set goals, (6) continuous assistance through positive reinforcement, (7) positive and negative reinforcement without rewards, and (8) progressive gamification for health professionals."[^1^][1]

### Aim of Paper
- The aim of the paper is to identify archetypes of gamification approaches that have emerged in health-related mobile apps and analyze how these approaches are influenced by the underlying desired health-related outcomes.

#### Key insights
- The paper identifies eight archetypes of gamification in mHealth apps.
- The identified archetypes have a close relationship with the actual health behavior that is being targeted.
- The study contributes to a more profound understanding of gamification in mobile health.
