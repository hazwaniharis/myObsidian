> [!tldr] Summary This paper presents a novel approach to gamify diabetes self-management for young adults in Saudi Arabia, where diabetes is highly prevalent. The authors introduce the Wheel of Sukr, a framework that incorporates elements from game design and behavioural theories to motivate and engage users in managing their illness. The framework aims to provide a fun, rewarding, and social experience that can reinforce positive behaviours and improve health outcomes.

### Aim of Paper

- To propose a conceptual framework for gamifying diabetes self-management in Saudi Arabia
- To identify the elements and sub-elements of the framework based on literature review and cultural context
- To discuss the potential benefits and challenges of applying gamification in healthcare

#### Key insights

- Gamification is a motivational tool that can influence behaviour and increase engagement in non-gaming contexts
- Diabetes is a common chronic illness that requires a lot of self-care and management skills
- Saudi Arabia has a high prevalence of diabetes and a lack of digital health services for diabetic patients
- The Wheel of Sukr is a framework that combines gamification and behavioural change methods to assist in self-management of diabetes
- The framework consists of eight elements: self-monitoring, socializing, self-representation, gamification, esteem, motivation, sustainability, and growth
- The framework emphasizes the link between gamification and behaviour change, and incorporates elements that are relevant and tailored to the Saudi culture and context
